PSA(Program for Structural Analysis) is a software to analyse Framed structures using FEM(Direct Stiffness Method). Apart from giving the analysed results, PSA is able to give user the various stiffness Matrices generated during the analysis in form of web page. Key feature are:
* Performs Analysis of Framed structures
* Reports intermediate steps involved in analysis in HTML(web) file
* Support for STAAD model file
* Matrices involved in computation are reported
* Results can be easily cross verified by comparing with STAAD.pro results
* Complete static analysis results are obtained
* Uses FEM (Direct Stiffness Method) for analysis
* Results include Support Reactions,SFD,BMD,Axial forces and Deflections in all possible directions

The working software is hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/psafem/
